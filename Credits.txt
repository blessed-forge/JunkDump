Special Thanks to

Aiiane @ irc.freenode.net #WARUIDev
Helped me tons with my initial questions and getting my head around LUA addons. Also used
an initial bit of her Yabber code to start me off. Also helped me debug the addon before 
Preview Weekend with typos, helping fix the code up, and helping finally figure out the
problems we have had with the button. She is awesome. Thanks so much!
Go check out her addons on war.curse.com
